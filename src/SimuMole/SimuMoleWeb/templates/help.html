        <h4>PDB file</h4>
        <p style="font-size: medium">
            Protein Data Bank (PDB) file is a <strong>textual file</strong> that describing the <strong>three-dimensional
            structures</strong> of the molecules by storing <strong>ATOM records</strong>
            (which represents atomic coordinates, occupancy, temperature factor and more) for each atom in the molecule.
            <br>You can <strong>find PDB files </strong>describing a variety of molecules <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">here</a>
            and you can also generate your own PDB file
            (note that this includes learning the mechanics of a PDB file or use some external tool).

        <h4>DCD file</h4>
        <p style="font-size: medium">
            DCD trajectory file is a <strong>binary file</strong> that contains the <strong>atomic coordinates</strong>
            of the atoms for <strong>every time step</strong> of the simulation.
            <br>You can <strong>download</strong> the DCD file generated by our Simulation and <strong>use it later</strong> in our Simulation or in other programs
            (like PyMOL) as well.

        <h4>How to view a Simulation using existing PDB and DCD files?</h4>
        <p style="font-size: medium">
            <strong style="font-size: large;">1.</strong> Click on the <strong>Upload PDB & DCD</strong> tab.
            <br><strong style="font-size: large;">2.</strong> Click on <strong>Choose File</strong>, navigate to your
            PDB / DCD file and open it. Do it for both PDB and DCD files, and make sure they are corresponding.
            <br><strong style="font-size: large;">3.</strong> Click on <strong>Upload</strong>.

        <h4>How to view your proteins in the PyMOL program?</h4>
        <p style="font-size: medium">
            <strong style="font-size: large;">1.</strong> Make sure you have PyMOL installed on your computer.
            If not, you can download it from
            <a href="www.pymol.org/2/#download">here</a> and then follow the instructions to install it.
            <br><strong style="font-size: large;">2.</strong> After you open PyMOL, click the <strong>file</strong> tab
            and then click the <strong>open</strong> option.
            <br><strong style="font-size: large;">3.</strong> In the open window, navigate to your <strong>PDB file</strong>
            and open it. You will see the proteins that the PDB file represent.

        <h4>How to view your simulation in the PyMOL program?</h4>
        <p style="font-size: medium">
            <strong style="font-size: large;">1.</strong> Do the steps above to open the <strong>PDB file</strong>.
            <br><strong style="font-size: large;">2.</strong> Repeat <strong>1.</strong>
            with the <strong>DCD file</strong> to open the DCD file
            (make sure that the PDB file and the DCD file are <strong>fit</strong>). In the popped-up window, click on <strong>load</strong>.
            <br><strong style="font-size: large;">3.</strong> click on the <strong>play</strong> button in the right bottom corner.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>Note that our capability of setting the relative position between molecules is limited,
            so we encourage you to upload 1 PDB file that contains the merged molecules. You can do that using the PyMOL program.
